#### Latex

Latex:

- describes content and layout for PDF files
- long-standing standard for scientific publishing
- aims to separate content from presentation
- can handle complex formulas and layouts
- gives stable output on different platforms
- has a process to include bibliograpy
- often a preferred format for journal submissions

Drawbacks:

- the price you pay is overhead: large installation pakages and document manipulations requires skill
- not too readable without prior knowledge, very hard to write from scratch  
- easier when working on an existing project or working in a template

Cutting edge:

- [online editors](https://blog.typeset.io/the-only-latex-editor-guide-youll-need-in-2018-e63868fae027)
  cut down installation burden and provide visual functionality
- ... yet you loose some of control over files
- alternative is git-based workflow to handle
