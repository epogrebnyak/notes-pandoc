## Introduction

Open-source computing and publishing tools make 
a promise of promptly accessible and reproducible research 
which allows faster peer feedback, better research result 
exposition and easier dissemination.

However, making research reproducible is a rather new skill. 

Aquiring such a skill is a cost and sustaining end-to-end 
reproducible workflow from research inputs to finished 
publication is an investment and requires commitment
to high technical  standards.

I provide guidelines to choose tools and techniques 
with low technical burden and good connectivity options 
reduces these costs. My productivity advice is that a 
researcher can use lower-level tools to avoid lock-in 
into particular framework or workflow.


## 1. General topics:

**1.1. Progress of science, or why communicate your findings?**

  - documenting findings, proof of discovery
  - extending knowledge
  - verification
  
**1.2. Research process and outcomes**

  - incentives, research quality and gaps in science
  - dissemination and open access
  - bibliography and citations
  - peer review
  
**1.3. Reproducible research**

  - was clear and accountable research always a stated and actual goal?
  - can this goal be fulfilled now?

## 2. Approaches

- Research design: context, problem, hypothesis, solution
- Analysis is a DAG (and iterations)
- Findings: statements, abstract
- Steps: plan, execute, test, document, refactor

## 3. Practical skills

### 3.1. Basic productivity

- Text editors and lightweight markup (`.md`, `.rst`, `.asciidoc`)
- Visualisation: more is less
- Managing bibliography: doi, crossref
- Hosting and revision: git, aws s3

### 3.2. Tips for better writing

- [Just write and have your writing reviewed](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/731/how-to-improve-technical-writing)

### 3.3. Research frontend

- Notebook wars: combining prose, maths, code and illustrations
- Interactive apps: shiny, plotly, bokeh
- Lightweight presentations: reveal.js and beamer (PDF)
- Books, reports, articles in PDF
- Formats of tomorrow: [distill](https://distill.pub)


Quote:

> Significant intellectual contributions can be made in the design or conceptualization of a study, the conduct of research, the analysis or interpretation of data, or the drafting or revising of a manuscript for intellectual content. (In Fostering Integrity in Research - AIChE)


Research quality:

- intellectual contribution
- problem solution 
- 'insight'
