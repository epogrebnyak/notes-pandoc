# Reproducible research

## Abstract

Open-source computing and publishing tools make 
a promise of promptly accessible and reproducible research 
which allows faster experimentation and better result discovery 
and dissemination.

However, making research reproducible is a new skill. 
Aquiring such a skill is a cost and sustaining end-to-end 
reproducible workflow from research inputs to finished 
publication is an investment and requires commitment
to high technical  standards.

Choosing tools and techniques with low technical burden 
and good connectivity options reduces these costs. 

## Is authoring much different now?

## 1. General topics:

**1.1. Progress of science, or why communicate your findings?**

  - proof of discovery / document findings
  - extending knowledge
  - verification
  
**1.2. Research process and outcomes**

  - incentives, quality and gaps in science
  - dissemination and open access
  - bibliography and citations
  - peer review
  
**1.3. Reproducible research**

  - was clear and accountable research always a stated and actual goal?
  - can this goal be fulfilled now?

## 2. Approaches

- Research design: context, problem, hypothesis, solution
- Analysis is a DAG (and iterations)
- Findings: statements, abstract
- Steps: plan, execute, test, document, refactor

## 3. Practical skills

### 3.1. Basic productivity

- Text editors and lightweight markup (`.md`, `.rst`, `.asciidoc`)
- Visualisation: more is less
- Managing bibliography: doi, crossref
- Hosting and revision: git, aws s3

### 3.2. Tips for better writing

- [Just write and have your writing reviewed](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/731/how-to-improve-technical-writing)

### 3.3. Research frontend

- Notebook wars: combining prose, maths, code and illustrations
- Interactive apps: shiny, plotly, bokeh
- Lightweight presentations: reveal.js and beamer (PDF)
- Books, reports, articles in PDF
- Formats of tomorrow: [distill](https://distill.pub)
