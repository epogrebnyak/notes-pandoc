## Abstract

Modern open-source computing and publishing tools make 
a promise of reproducible and promptly accessible research 
as well as faster experimentation.

However, new skill aquisition is a cost and sustaining 
of open-source workflow is an investment, specifically 
in maintaining end-to-end pipeline from research inputs 
to finished publication.

Choosing tools and techniques with low technical burden 
reduces these costs. 

## Is it much different now?

## 1. General topics:

1. Why communicate your findings?
  - proof of learning
  - document findings
  - extending knowledge
  - verification
  
2. Research process and outcomes
  - incentives, quality and gaps in science
  - dissemination and open access
  - bibliography and citations
  
3. Reproducible research
  - was clear and accountable research always a goal?
  - can this goal be fulfilled now?

## 2. Approaches

- Research design: context, problem, hypothesis, solution
- Analysis is a DAG (and iterations)
- Findings: statements, abstract
- Steps: plan, execute, test, document, refactor

## 3. Practical skills

### Basic productivity

- Text editors and lightweight markup (`.md`, `.rst`, `.asciidoc`)
- Visualisation: more is less
- Managing bibliography
- Hosting and revision: git, aws s3

### Tips for better writing

- [Just write and have your writing reviewed](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/731/how-to-improve-technical-writing)

### Research frontend

- Notebook wars: combining prose, formulas, code and illustrations
- Interactive apps: shiny, plotly, bokeh
- Lightweight presentations: reveal.js and beamer
- Books, reports, articles in PDF
- Formats of tomorrow: [https://distill.pub]
