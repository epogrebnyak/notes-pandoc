Markdown to PDF workflow using pandoc


## Abstract

Modern open-source computing tools make a promise of 
reproducible, accessible and more clear research findings. 

However, new skill aquisition and sustaining of open-source
workflow comes at a cost. This cost can go down 
with a choice of tools and techniques with low technical burden.

Chained together these tools allow easier experimentation and 
faster delivery of research findings.

## 1. General topics:

1. Why communicate your findings?
  - proof of learning
  - document findings
  - extending knowledge
  - verification
  
2. Research process and outcomes
  - incentives, quality and gaps in science
  - dissemination and open access
  - bibliography and citations
  
3. Reproducible research
  - was clear and accountable research always a goal?
  - can this goal be fulfilled now?

## 2. Approaches

- Research design: context, problem, hypothesis, solution
- Analysis is a DAG (and iterations)
- Findings statement and abstract
- Steps: plan, execute, test, document, refactor

## 3. Practical skills

### Basic productivity

- Hosting and revision: git, aws s3
- Text editors and lightweight markup (`.md`, `.rst`, `.asciidoc`)
- Visualisation: more is less
- Managing bibliography

### Tips for better writing

- [Just write and have your writing reviewed](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/731/how-to-improve-technical-writing)

### Research frontend

- Notebook wars: combining prose, code and illustrations
- Apps: shiny, plotly, bokeh
- Lightweight presentations
- Books, reports, articles
- Formats of tomorrow: [https://distill.pub]
